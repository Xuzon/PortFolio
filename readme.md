# C#

Was my first OOP language, I was self-tought with this language, when I first started with it I'd only known C,
so it was a challenge to learn OOP by my own, I have more projects with this language using Unity3D, if you want to know more talk with me

# C++

* [Image processing software](https://github.com/Xuzon/ImageProcessing) (Face recognition, brightness, contrast, different image effects). I used QT for UI

* [MUSVI](https://github.com/MUSVI-LPRO) a tablet application to translate rythm into partitures, specially designed for school learning
[Telefonica Think Big prize winner](http://catedraietelefonica.webs4.uvigo.es/premios-think-big-h4g-vigo/)

* [UCM Master's Degree on Game Development](http://videojuegos-ucm.es/)

### Examples
 - [Games](#games)

# C

Was my first high level language, before this I've only programmed with assembly.

### Examples

* I customized the **Linux Kernel** with auxiliar functions,
* I made a **custom CPU scheduler** with the kernel.
* **Multithreaded** programming.
* **Distributed** programming.
* **Inverse engineering** with the Mirai BotNet source code

# Java

My most used language in the college, I made a lot of stuff in Java

### Examples

* **Distributed** programming
* **Concurrent** programming
* Http **Sever**
* **Servlets**
* [Android game](https://github.com/Xuzon/HexagonWars) with artificial intelligence
* [Artificial intelligence](https://github.com/Xuzon/psiLab)
* [Secure server](https://github.com/Xuzon/SegLab) where you can store and retrieve documents 
* [Server](https://github.com/Xuzon/MultiScreen) that use FFMPEG to split a video into the columns and rows you want and stream it 
* DB (MySql, MongoDB, XML)


# Shaders
Unity's shaders, these are advanced versions of what I have in my portfolio right now

- [Toonish](#toonish-shader)
- [Toonish Water](#water-toonish-shader)

## Toonish Shader

This is a Unity's surface shader with a pass before the real shader to do the outline. I've also written a custom lighting for this model "Toonish Lighting" where I use, the normal (bump map + vertex) and the specular color, I get the specular using the Metallic, Roughness and calling the Unity's function DiffuseAndSpecularByMetallic.

### Examples

* **Comparison** in a human model

* **Comparison** in a weapon model

## Toonish Ramp Shader

This is similar to my toonish shader but I use a ramp texture (classic toon shading) but I use it with the luminance and the color apart to achieve a different effect.

### Examples

* **My Ramp Toonish**

## Water Toonish Shader

This is a Unity's surface shader with a custom vertex function to do the waves. I've also written a custom lighting for this model "Toonish Lighting" (same that toonish shader). I use the depth textures to do the shore lines.

### Examples

* Shore lines with two **human models**

* Shore lines with **Terrain**

# SQL

I've learned MySQL in the college
