# Portfolio

This is Daniel Garrido (Xuzon) personal portfolio, I have some personal projects also that I can't make public yet
- [C](#c)
- [C-Sharp](#c-sharp)
- [Java](#java)
- [C++](#cpp)
- [Shaders](#shaders)
- [MySQL](#sql)


# C

Was my first high level language, before this I've only programmed with assembly.

### Examples

* I customized the **Linux Kernel** with auxiliar functions,
* I made a **custom CPU scheduler** with the kernel.
* **Multithreaded** programming.
* **Distributed** programming.
* **Inverse engineering** with the Mirai BotNet source code

# C-Sharp

Was my first OOP language, I was self-tought with this language, when I first started with it I'd only known C,
so it was a challenge to learn OOP by my own, I have 4 projects with this language using Unity3D, if you want to know more talk with me

### Examples
* My **first** project with this language and Unity3D was a procedural space game, here is a [demo](http://www.indiedb.com/games/space-is-our-land/downloads/space-is-our-land-alpha-demo), I made all what is in the game but the terrain textures.

# Java

My most used language in the college, I made a lot of stuff in Java

### Examples

* **Distributed** programming
* **Concurrent** programming
* Http **Sever**
* **Servlets**
* [Android game](https://github.com/Xuzon/HexagonWars) with artificial intelligence
* [Artificial intelligence](https://github.com/Xuzon/psiLab)
* [Secure server](https://github.com/Xuzon/SegLab) where you can store and retrieve documents 
* Server[(https://github.com/Xuzon/MultiScreen)] that use FFMPEG to split a video into the columns and rows you want and stream it 
* DB (MySql, MongoDB, XML)


# Cpp

My main approach with this language is an image processing software (Face recognition, brightness, contrast, different image effects).

# Shaders
Unity's shaders, these are advanced versions of what I have in my portfolio right now

- [Toonish](#toonish-shader)
- [Toonish Water](#water-toonish-shader)

## Toonish Shader

This is a Unity's surface shader with a pass before the real shader to do the outline. I've also written a custom lighting for this model "Toonish Lighting" where I use, the normal (bump map + vertex) and the specular color, I get the specular using the Metallic, Roughness and calling the Unity's function DiffuseAndSpecularByMetallic.

### Examples

* **Comparison** in a human model

## Toonish Ramp Shader

This is similar to my toonish shader but I use a ramp texture (classic toon shading) but I use it with the luminance and the color apart to achieve a different effect.

### Examples

* **My Ramp Toonish**

## Water Toonish Shader

This is a Unity's surface shader with a custom vertex function to do the waves. I've also written a custom lighting for this model "Toonish Lighting" (same that toonish shader). I use the depth textures to do the shore lines.

### Examples

* Shore lines with two **human models**

* Shore lines with **Terrain**

# SQL

I've learned MySQL in the college
